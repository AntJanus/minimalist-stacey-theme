Minimalist Stacey Theme
=======================

Minimalist theme for Stacey flat-file PHP-based CMS. It's much simpler and cleaner than the default theme and is easy to work with. 

The copyright of the photos belongs to me (I took them) but you are otherwise free and very welcome to take this theme and do whatever you want with it. 

Uses:

* [Base Theme](http://antjan.us/labs/minimalist-stacey-theme/)
* [Renew Life Balance](http://renewlifebalance.com)
* [Starting My Own Family](http://startingmyownfamily.com)
