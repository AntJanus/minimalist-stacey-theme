minimalist-stacey-theme
=======================

Minimalist theme for Stacey flat-file PHP-based CMS. It's much simpler and cleaner than the default theme and is easy to work with. 

The copyright of the photos belongs to me (I took them) but you are otherwise free and very welcome to take this theme and do whatever you want with it. 

Uses:

* [Renew Life Balance](http://renewlifebalance.com)
* [Starting My Own Family](http://startingmyownfamily.com)

## Changelog

I would like to implement a feature-based change log since I most likely won't be tagging my commits. The newest will be on top, the oldest on the bottom.

### February 9th 

Separation of  "head" into "head.html" partial so that it's easier to add tracking code like google analytics and webmasters verification
