Minimalist Stacey Theme
=======================

Minimalist theme for Stacey flat-file PHP-based CMS. It's much simpler and cleaner than the default theme and is easy to work with. 

The copyright of the photos belongs to me (I took them) but you are otherwise free and very welcome to take this theme and do whatever you want with it. 

Uses:

* [Base Theme](http://antjan.us/labs/minimalist-stacey-theme/)
* [Renew Life Balance](http://renewlifebalance.com)
* [Starting My Own Family](http://startingmyownfamily.com)

##Future Plans

What are the future plans for this minimalist theme?

* stabilize for this version of Stacey
* fully implement Foundation
* add polishing styling

What about after that?

* Update to Stacey 3.0 
* possibly create my own file-based CMS to circumvent dependence on Stacey

## Changelog

I would like to implement a feature-based change log since I most likely won't be tagging my commits. The newest will be on top, the oldest on the bottom.
